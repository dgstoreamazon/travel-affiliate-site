# Travel Affiliate Site (FREE Hosting Ready)

A lightweight, mobileâ€‘first oneâ€‘page site for your **Pinterest â†’ Website â†’ Amazon** funnel.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (GitHub Pages â€” 100% Free)

1. Create a GitHub account (free) if you don't have one.
2. New repository named **travel-affiliate-site** (public).
3. Upload these files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`.
4. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**. Under "Build and deployment", choose **Deploy from a branch**, then select **main** and `/ (root)`.
5. Wait ~1 minute. Your site will be live at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/travel-affiliate-site/`

### Replace Links
Open `index.html` and find `YOUR_AMAZON_AFFILIATE_LINK_X` â€” replace with your Associate links.

### Map Pins â†’ Sections
- Your Pinterest **Destination Link** should be this site (or a specific anchor like `#picks`).
- You can duplicate `article.card` blocks to make more product sections (e.g., Long Flight Kit, Beach Day, Family Travel).

## ðŸ†“ Even Simpler (Google Sites)
- Go to **sites.google.com â†’ Create**.
- Make a single section per product with your pin image and **Button** that uses your Amazon link.
- Paste the **Affiliate Disclosure** at the top or footer.

## âœ… Compliance Tips
- Keep the **Affiliate Disclosure** visible (already included near the top).
- Mark links as `rel="sponsored nofollow"` (already done).
- Use your **own photos or royaltyâ€‘free** (the demo uses Unsplash placeholder images).
- Avoid price claims unless you can keep them up to date.

## ðŸ§  SEO Tips
- Change the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` in `index.html` to your keywords (e.g., "Best Travel Gadgets 2025").
- Add more H2 sections targeting keywords: "Carryâ€‘On Packing Hacks", "Beach Mustâ€‘Haves", etc.

## ðŸ§© Customization
- Colors, fonts, and layout live in `styles.css`.
- Add logos, a header image, or your email capture (e.g., ConvertKit form) later if you want.
